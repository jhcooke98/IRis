# Example firmware file - replace with actual compiled firmware
# This is just a placeholder file to demonstrate the naming convention

# To create actual firmware:
# 1. Open your Arduino IDE with your IR Remote Mini project
# 2. Go to Sketch -> Export Compiled Binary
# 3. Rename the .bin file using the version convention
# 4. Copy it to this directory

# Version: 1.0.0
# Placeholder content
